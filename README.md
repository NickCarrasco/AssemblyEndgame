## Experience Gained

- Developed a hangman like app where players guess hidden word by selecting letters from an interactive keyboard
- Developed the application using React for building user interfaces, HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for implementing game logic and interactivity.
- Implemented real-time feedback with color-coded buttons: green for correct guesses and red for incorrect ones.
- Provided a restart option upon game completion to encourage replayability.
- Utilized React components to structure the game interface, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- Managed game state using React's `useState` hook and derived values from state to track guessed letters and remaining attempts.
- Implemented event handling to update the UI based on user interactions, providing immediate feedback.
